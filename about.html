            Hello! I'm Gucha Duncan, a passionate and versatile professional in both web development and graphic design. With a keen eye for aesthetics and a love for coding, I thrive in the dynamic intersection of creativity and technology.

Web Development:
In the realm of web development, I craft immersive digital experiences that combine functionality with elegance. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks like React and Vue.js, I specialize in creating responsive and user-friendly websites. From clean and minimalist designs to bold and interactive interfaces, I ensure that every website I build not only meets but exceeds the client's expectations.

Graphic Design:
As a graphic designer, I bring ideas to life through visual storytelling. Armed with Adobe Creative Suite tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, I design captivating logos, stunning branding materials, eye-catching illustrations, and engaging user interfaces. I understand the power of visual communication and leverage it to convey messages effectively while leaving a lasting impression.
